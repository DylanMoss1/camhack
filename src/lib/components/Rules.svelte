    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3>Entry rules</h3>
    <ul class="pl-8 list-disc">
        <li>
            The maximum team size is 4. Any bigger, and we might have to split
            you up. Solo participation is allowed, but hacking is better with
            other people!
        </li>
        <li>
            Participants must be students at the University of Cambridge. They
            must not have had an advantage such as getting to decide the theme,
            or being a judge.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>House rules</h3>
    <ul class="pl-8 list-disc">
        <li>
            Please do not bring food into the Intel lab! All food must stay
            downstairs in the street. &#127829;
        </li>
        <li>
            We don't recommend it, but you can stay overnight in the lab if you
            want. &#128564;
        </li>
        <li>
            All participants must follow our <a
                href="/code-of-conduct"
                class="theme-hyperlink">Code of Conduct</a
            >.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Submission rules</h3>
    <ul class="pl-8 list-disc">
        <li>
            All work on projects must be done at the hackathon. Using existing
            code is allowed if credited, but the project should be substantially
            new.
        </li>
        <li>Code submissions may be no more than 2 GB in size.</li>
        <li>
            After hacking finishes, representatives for each track will go
            around to look at each demo. You are free to look at other projects,
            as long as one team member is present a demo of their project.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you discover a breaking bug during your demo with a trivial fix,
            that's okay to fix. &#128027;
        </li>
        <li>
            Submissions will be made to <a
                href="https://devpost.com"
                class="theme-hyperlink">Devpost</a
            >.
